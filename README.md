# roboadvisor
 
 Hi, welcome to the roboadvisor project. 

 The roboadvisor is a tool you can use to check the performance of your favorite stocks, and let you know whether our team thinks it's a good idea to purchase said stock for investment purposes. 

 Our methodology is as follows:
    Buy if the stock is trading below 90 percent of its most recent high. (i.e., Buy if Last Closing Price < (0.9* Recent High Price))
